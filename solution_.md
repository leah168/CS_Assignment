**Q5: Create one plot from the dataset "istherecorrelation.csv", with DPI=300. The objective is to visualize the data in a way that you consider representative. Include the resulting plot image in the markdown file and add a few lines of interpretation on the data.**

* Trend: From 2006 to 2018, the dataset covers a time span of 13 years. During this period, the consumption of beer in the Netherlands shows an overall upward trend. However, the data also indicates fluctuations in some years. These fluctuations could be influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, seasonal demand, market trends, and more.

* Increase in Dutch Beer Consumption: The column "NL Beer consumption [x1000 hectoliter]" represents the consumption of beer in the Netherlands, measured in thousand hectoliters. From the data, it is evident that this value increased from 11,402 thousand hectoliters in 2006 to 12,048 thousand hectoliters in 2018.

* Another Indicator Related to Year, WO: The column "WO [x1000]" represents another indicator related to the year. It also shows an annual increase during this time period. From the trend chart, it appears that these two variables exhibit some degree of similarity. However, it cannot be conclusively determined whether there is a correlation between them, as further analysis is required to quantify their relationship.
